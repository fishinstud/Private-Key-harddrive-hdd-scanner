Detailed Summary

This cross-platform Python script is designed to search through a user-specified directory (and all of its subdirectories) for potential private keys formatted in Base58. It not only identifies these keys but also converts each found key into its Wallet Import Format (WIF) version. The script is carefully built to work on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

Core Functionality

1. Directory Validation:

Function: validate_path

Purpose: Ensures that the user-provided directory path exists and is indeed a directory. This check works on any operating system.

Usage: Before scanning begins, the script validates the input. If the path is invalid, it outputs an error message and terminates the execution.



2. Recursive Directory Scanning:

Function: scan_directory_for_private_keys

Purpose: Walks through the specified directory and all its subdirectories, examining every file.

How It Works:

Uses Pythonâ€™s os.walk to iterate through directories.

For each file encountered, the script attempts to open it in binary mode.

The file content is then decoded using UTF-8 (ignoring any errors), which allows the script to handle files with non-text data.

A precompiled regular expression (BASE58_REGEX) is used to search the decoded text for strings matching the Base58 format (defined by the pattern [13][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{52}).

If a match is found, the key is added to a set, automatically removing any duplicate keys.

The script prints progress messages indicating which directories are being scanned, when keys are found, and if any files are skipped due to permission issues or other errors.




3. Private Key Conversion:

Function: convert_base58_to_wif

Purpose: Converts a found Base58 private key to its Wallet Import Format (WIF) version.

Conversion Logic:

If the key length is 52, it prepends the prefix '80' to the key.

Otherwise, it uses the prefix '00'.


This conversion process is a simplified version and assumes that the prefixing is sufficient for the intended use case.



4. User Interaction and Script Flow:

Main Function: main

Steps:

1. User Input: Prompts the user to enter a valid directory path. The prompt is designed to accommodate both Windows (e.g., C:\Users\User) and Linux (e.g., /home/user) path formats.


2. Validation: Uses the validate_path function to confirm that the path is correct.


3. Scanning: If the path is valid, the script starts scanning the directory recursively using the scan_directory_for_private_keys function.


4. Displaying Results: Once the scan is complete, the script:

Prints all found private keys.

Converts each key to its WIF version using the convert_base58_to_wif function.

Outputs both the original key and its corresponding WIF version.



5. Error Handling: Throughout the process, if any errors occur (like permission issues or file not found), the script logs these events to the console and continues processing the remaining files.






How to Use the Script

1. Preparation:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Save the script to a file, for example, key_scanner.py.



2. Running the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

Execute the script by typing:

python key_scanner.py

When prompted, enter a valid directory path where you want the scan to begin. You can enter a path in either Windows or Linux format depending on your operating system.



3. Understanding the Output:

The script will display messages as it scans each directory.

For every file it processes, if a Base58 private key is found, it will print:

A message indicating the file in which the key was discovered.

The key itself.

The converted WIF version of the key.


If no keys are found, it will simply inform you that no private keys were detected.



4. Handling Errors:

If the script encounters files it cannot access due to permission restrictions or other errors, it will skip those files and continue scanning the rest of the directory.

An invalid path will prompt an error message and the script will exit.
